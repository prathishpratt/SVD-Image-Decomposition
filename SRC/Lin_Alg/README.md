## Linear Algebra Method - SVD for Image Compression

The [Image_SVD](https://github.com/prathishpratt/SVD-Image-Decomposition/blob/main/SRC/Lin_Alg/Image_SVD.ipynb) notebook is the crux of our project. It has the code for Image Compression using the Singular Value Decomposition technique. Please make sure to have all the dependencies and the stock images downloaded. 

The [Evaluation_metric](https://github.com/prathishpratt/SVD-Image-Decomposition/blob/main/SRC/Lin_Alg/Evaluation_metric.ipynb) notebook has the functions for the evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These functions are being imported into the [Image_SVD](https://github.com/prathishpratt/SVD-Image-Decomposition/blob/main/SRC/Lin_Alg/Image_SVD.ipynb) notebook.

The [Images](https://github.com/prathishpratt/SVD-Image-Decomposition/tree/main/SRC/Lin_Alg/Images) folder has the stock images. Please download that or else you can change the path if you want to use your own images.
